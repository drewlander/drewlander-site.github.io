<p>I have a Fedora box that I use as a home personal server. It runs various services. However because the more monitors the better, and
I believe in having as many HUDS and graphs as humanly possible, it IS running X and has a monitor attached to it. I had some music files
on that server I wanted to play while I was working on my Macbook. I could mount the filesystem from my Macbook and play the file, but what fun is that?
Instead, why can&rsquo;t I just tell my computer where to send the audio to and have it work? Turns out, you can!</p>

<p>Install Pulseaudio on OSX:
{% highlight bash %}
brew install pulseaudio
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>I am assuming X is running and some kind of DE is configured on the Linux box.</p>

<p>Start Pulseaudio on OSX:</p>

<p>{% highlight bash %}
pulseaudio &ndash;load=module-native-protocol-tcp &ndash;exit-idle-time=-1 &ndash;daemon
pactl load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=<ip of streaming client>
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>Tell Linux where to send the audio:
{% highlight bash %}
PULSE_SERVER=<ip of OSX BOx> vlc <filename>
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>PROFIT!</p>
