However I also enjoy listening to music with <a href="https://6xq.net/pianobar/">Pianobar</a> but saw there was no love to make the current song playing show in the touchbar. The following is what I did to make it work. Mac OSX 10.14.5 is what I am using, but this can also be made to work on any *nix distro as well.</p>

<p>My repo of files are located <a href="https://github.com/drewlander/configfiles/tree/master/mtmr">here</a></p>

<p>You have to change the config for pianobar to find pianobar-notify.rb. You can do this by adding the following in ~/.config/pianobar/config:</p>

<p>{% highlight bash %}
event_command = /full/path/to/pianobar-notify.rb
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>Take note that in the MTMR config (items.json) the weather api is redacted, get your own! Also inside pianobar_notify.rb you need to change the full path to where the file goes.</p>

<p>Other than that, it works for me! Horray!</p>
