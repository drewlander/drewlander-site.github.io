<p>I have read many places that having a blog is a good thing. Even if you have on there something
that you think anyone should know, there may be that one person out there who doesnâ€™t know, who
somehow finds your blog, and you help them. Major Hayden said something like that. Anyway,
this will be a technical blog. I am self taught (no collge) so I am sure there will be lots
of people correcting me, which is good, because then I will learn :)</p>
