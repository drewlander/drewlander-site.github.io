I have read many places that having a blog is a good thing. Even if you have on there something
that you think anyone should know, there may be that one person out there who doesn't know, who
somehow finds your blog, and you help them. Anyway,
this will be a technical blog. I am self taught (no collge) so I am sure there will be lots
of people correcting me, which is good, because then I will learn :)
Yes this blog is using Jekyll. I love doing a git commit and BAM, updated site. 
Just have a lot to figure out to make it look nice.
